     * Compares string1 with string2 using php's string similarity functions.
     *
     * This function is similar to similarity() except for several key aspects:
     *
     * 1) This function compares strings starting at the beginning and 
     *  iterates through the string characters.
     * 2) This function defaults to unidirectional mode, meaning the order 
     *  of its arguments matters. A short string compared against a long 
     *  string can yield a 100% match, and will disregard the tail of the 
     *  longer string.
     * 3) This function weights the strings, placing higher value on 
     *  similarities from certain portions of the strings than on others.
     *
     * The initial concept of this function was to use direct character
     *  comparison between the strings; however, that approach quickly loses 
     *  accuracy in the presence of missing or added characters, so this 
     *  implementation uses a rolling levenshtein distance while iterating over
     *  both input strings, adding a character to each compared substring with
     *  each iteration.

     * @param string $string1
     *  The base string we are comparing against.
     * @param string $string2

     * @param int $gradient
     *  This parameter configures the weighting formula. A higher number means
     *  a greater weight difference between beginning and end of the string.
     *  See weightFormula() for more info. In practice, this parameter does
     *  not appear to really do much, so the default is generally a good choice.
     *  The incremental levenshtein used by this function already provides a 
     *  kind of gradiential weighting simply by virtue of how it operates.
